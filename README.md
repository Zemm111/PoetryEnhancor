# PoetryEnhancor
A script to enhance your poetry via re-arrangement.  DL and run locally. Seems to contain magical properties, but if your effects are not strong experiment with crystal placements on CPU.

The PoetryEnhancor uses a cutup technique to elaborate one's linear sense of authorship into a novel manifestation of monads within any text.  It works well with line-by-line poetry, but feel free to experiment with other things.

Q: Couldn't I just do this in excel?

A: Sure, but this script seems to work better than that.  
I think that things made with intention sometimes open portals to communications with entities that can help guide us, 
and this script seems to land in that arena.  
However, feel free to create your own!  Maybe it will work even better.
